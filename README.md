# 🧠 Basic Codes & Practice Projects

Welcome to my sandbox repo — a collection of small but meaningful code projects I’ve written while learning the foundations of software development and computer science.

This repo includes:
- 📚 Data Structures & Algorithm exercises
- 🔁 Loop & logic practice
- 🧮 Math-based problems
- 🧠 Problem-solving challenges
- 🧪 Experimentation with core concepts in Python and C++

These aren't flashy full-stack apps or machine learning models (yet), but every line here is a step forward.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 💻 **Languages**: Python, C++  
- 🧰 **Tools**: VS Code, Git  
- 💡 **Concepts**: Recursion, Sorting, Searching, OOP, Arrays, Strings, etc.

## 🧭 Why This Repo Exists

You can’t build intelligent systems without knowing how the parts work. This repo is where I:
- Practiced solving problems efficiently
- Experimented with syntax and logic
- Made peace with bugs (and learned to squash them)

---

## 🚧 Status

Ongoing. I’ll keep updating this as I grow, tackle more advanced problems, and rewrite older code with better structure.

---

## 📎 Notes

This repo is intentionally raw and honest. It's not optimized, production-ready code — it's my proof of progress. Some of the solutions are first drafts. Others have been refactored. Either way, I'm proud of all of them.
